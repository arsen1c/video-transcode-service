Transcode videos with ease into multiple resolutions. The primary goal is to learn about making the backend scalable by leveraging aws services. The services and tools that are used are:
- AWS S3 Buckets: To store the videos
- AWS SQS: Used as a messaging queue
- AWS Fargate: To spin up docker containers
- FFMPEG: To get the juice out of the videos
